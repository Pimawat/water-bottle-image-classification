# Project Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify water bottle images based on their water levels. The model will be trained on a dataset of water bottle images, with each image being labeled as Full water level, Half water level, or Overflowing. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify a given water bottle image based on its water level.

# Potential Applications:
There are several potential applications for this machine learning model. One potential application is in the manufacturing of water bottles, where the model could be used to automatically classify and separate water bottles based on their water levels. This could help streamline the manufacturing process and improve efficiency.

Another potential application is in the development of automated systems for monitoring and managing water levels in containers. For example, the model could be used to track the water levels in water bottles or other containers and alert users when the water level is low or reaching capacity.

Overall, the model has the potential to be used in a variety of applications related to water levels in containers, including both business and research purposes.
